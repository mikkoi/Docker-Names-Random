=head1 STATUS

This module is currently being developed so changes in the API are possible,
though unlikely.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # As an object (if you create many, this is more efficient).
    require Docker::Names::Random;

    my $dnr = Docker::Names::Random->new();
    my $random_name1 = $dnr->docker_name();

    # As an imported function.
    use Docker::Names::Random qw( docker_name );
    # OR
    use Docker::Names::Random qw( :all );

    my $random_name2 = docker_name();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you are using Docker, you may have noticed that it
creates random names for containers when you haven't provided any
specific name. These names are a combination of an adjective
and a proper name of an individual. The individuals are
famous men and women picked from the history of scientific exploration
and engineering.

This package allows you to use the same system in your own programs.
You would get combinations like
I<interesting_mendeleev>,
I<epic_engelbart>,
I<lucid_dhawan>,
I<recursing_cori>,
I<ecstatic_liskov> and
I<busy_ardinghelli>.

The combination I<boring_wozniak> is not allowed because
L<Steve Wozniak|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak> is not boring.
This same limitation exists in the
L<original code|https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go>.
